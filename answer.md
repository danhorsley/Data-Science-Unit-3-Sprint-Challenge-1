### Part 7 - Questions (and your Answers)

Acme Corporation isn't just a few `.py` files. If you want to grow in your
career here, you'll have to answer the following:

- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?
  
  First of all make sure it is readable.  As is often said code is read far 
  more than it is writtenso make sure to follow some kind of guidelines like 
  pep8, putting in comments spacing things out etc to make them readable.  
  Also make sure that it is easy to follow (i.e. not spaghetti code) and 
  that there is not too much repetition
  
- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?
  
  Containers help you to test your programs in another or fixed environment 
  in a quick and easy manner. it's like a virtual machine (i.e. installing a virtual
  mac operating system on linux pc) but cuts down on all the unnecessary
  components of the virtual OS.  Dockers which are a kind of container
  automate the running of programs inside many different software containers.
